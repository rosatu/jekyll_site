Against my deepest impulse to crawl under a rock and hide from all things(especially the internet), I have joined a Programming bootcamp and been tasked with making a blog.

I start on Medium, which seems to be the standard, but then they ask me to sign in with Facebook or Google. I don't want to do that.

I go to Squarespace. Free. Great. I choose a theme, start looking at high-res photos of delicious food, and completely forget what I’m doing. Oh, right, blog. Programming. Then I see that my Squarespace blog wasn't really free, it was just a free trial. Fine whatever, jerks.

I briefly sign up for Wordpress until I get to the “packages” page. Ugh. $4 monthly fee. Why isn't anything free? We should all have the right to a simple digital pen and paper so we can upload our brains onto the collective human consciousness!

It is then that I stumble upon Jekyll. This appears to be a Ruby gem. Meaning it's a bunch o' code written in the Ruby language (computers understand different languages apparently) that anyone can just install on their computer and use as a blog template. This is great. I'll have to set it up, but who cares, I can learn stuff.

I can learn stuff. That is what I said to myself. Three days ago. Now it is 10pm, the night before I present, and despite asking my instructor(Hi Prince!), and googling everything, and spending an embarrassing number of hours trying to understand what's going on, I feel lost...

Wait a sec...

Nevermind, I don't feel lost. Or I guess I only feel half-lost. Okay. I think I can do this.

Hmmmmmmm...

Let me explain what's going on. After staring at lots of stuff for a very long time while being confused, it just occurred to me that what I want to do is quite simple.

What I've done so far is this:

-Tried to use three custom blogging sites and left each cause I was mad at it.

-Discovered that there are "open-source"(free and accessible) alternatives, one of which is called "Jekyll"

-Went to the Jekyll website and followed instructions to install

    The instructions said to type these words into the terminal:
    "gem install bundler jekyll" -- this put the jekyll code onto my computer
    "jekyll new whatever_name_you_want_blog" -- this created/named a new blog
    "cd whatever_name_you_want_blog" -- this gave me access to the blog

Then I replaced the Jekyll template with my own info and content...and that's kinda where we are now. Cause I'm still writing this so I don't want to post it yet.

But...

I probably should.

Okay, but let me work through this a little more. Right now if I run "jekyll serve" and browse to http://localhost:4000 I can see this content on a "local server." This means my computer is showing the site to itself.

But I want to be able to give my instructor a link. That way they can access my blog from their computer. Then they can project it on the wall at school and I can present it to my class.

So I guess I should post this site on a "remote server." Which I think just means pushing it to Github. Is it really that simple? Where did this epiphany come from? What was I even thinking about before?

Well... let's hope I'm right. Can't tell you yet. I have to finish this post first in order to see whether I've succeeded. But chances are, if you're seeing this, I have.

p.s. Github is a "repository hosting service." In other words it's a place to store stuff on the web. Many developers use it. We use it at school.

p.p.s. The terminal is a magic window for texting your computer important questions like “wut files u have in u?”, “will u install dis 4 me?”, and "u up?"
